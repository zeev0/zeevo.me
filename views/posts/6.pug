  h2 1. Create an AWS EC2 instance
  p Log into 
    a(href="https://aws.amazon.com/") AWS 
    | and create an account if you don't have one already. Log in and you should see your dashboard, or a list
    | of services
  +limg('/img/posts/6-a.png')
  p Select EC2. Then select Launch Instance.
  +limg('/img/posts/6-b.png')
  p If you're just prototyping a simple website then choosing the latest Ubuntu Server image is fine.
    |  Make sure to save your private key somewhere safe.

  h2 2. Connecting to your EC2 instance
  p Test your new EC2 instance by connecting to it.
  code ssh -i keyname.pem user@your-ec2-address
  p Or press the Connect button while on your EC2 console for exact instructions.
  p Your ec2 address looks something like 
    code ec2-55-55-555-55.xx-yyyy-5.compute.amazonaws.com
  p Success? Great good to go!

  h2 3. Setup your Security Groups
  p Let's open up some ports so requests can make it to our VM. At the AWS Boardboard, find the link to "Security Groups" on the left
  +limg('/img/posts/6-c.png') 
  p Then click "Create"
  +limg('/img/posts/6-e.png') 
  p Make the following rules
  +limg('/img/posts/6-d.png') 
  p Click the "Create" button in the bottom right. 
    | Next, go back to "Instances" and under "Actions" select "Networking"->"Change Security Groups" and 
    | select your newly created security group. Mine was called something like 
    i launch-wizard-1
    | . Remember to click "Assign Security Groups" after you
    | check the box.

  h3 Create your Elastic IP
  p This allows for better DNS.
